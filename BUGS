NamingTools
	Cause: Laziness, using strs like an idiot

	Description:
NamingTools is broken. This is because the quick, hacky bullshit I pumped into
FormatTools, specifically into the writeWrapper, is no longer there. Whenever
a weirdly encoded string is passed to stuff, random errors are going to start
appearing everywhere.
	
	Solution:
The solution is to read dirnames as python's pretend version of unicode, and
treat a str like an actually immutable str SHOULD be treated. When I'm not
tired and overworked, I should go through every function in NamingTools and
ensure that directory input is truly sanitized and properly preserved.
