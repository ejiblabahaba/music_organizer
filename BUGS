KNOWN BUGS: (rev 0.2)
-I need a better way of handling unicode errors than throwing unicode at the
 wall and hoping it sticks. createSuggestions() is a primary and necessary
 example: directories are constantly breaking the open interface because there
 are characters that python just can't handle. I'm unsure of a solution, but I
 plan to speak with a developer I know well who has probably dealt with many of
 these same issues in the implementation of a chat client.
-There are an unusually large number of $UNKN$ values being suggested for codecs.
 I presume this is a problem with getVBRQuality() not correctly identifying the
 VBR header, or otherwise yielding senseless values.
