MusicManager Revision 0.3:

MusicManager is a collection of hacky garbage designed to handle all of my
music. It started as an attempt to make my media collection parsable at the
folder level. Now, I plan to make it parsable at the file level as well, and
I hope to incorporate automated tagging for files lacking it. Eventually, I
may even tie everything together in a spiffy GUI.

This project is an earnest attempt to expand my understanding of large-scale
project workflow, the use of GitHub as a resource, and management of the kind
of complexity that large-scale projects evolve over time. It's not going to be
extremely high quality, and it probably won't be very professional.

Whatever. It'll be fun.
