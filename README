MusicManager Revision 0.2:

MusicManager is a collection of hacky garbage designed to handle the obnoxious
directories in my music folder which don't conform to my specifications, but
were added from sources where this could not immediately be helped (i.e. low
overall quality of directory/tagging curation). Its current scope only works
with directory renaming, but in the future it's very likely that the program
could be used as a fully functional music manager.

This project is an earnest attempt to expand my understanding of large-scale
project workflow, the use of GitHub as a resource, and management of the kind
of complexity that large-scale projects evolve over time. I'm coding to the
best of my ability, though time constraints often limit my ability to comment
larger sections of complex functions, an issue I hope to fix over time.

Since I'm working two other jobs totaling over 60 hrs a week, I don't have much
time or effort to sink into this project, or this readme. All the code is well-
documented in most cases, though I can think of a couple of small exceptions.
The point is, you're on your own if you feel any of this stuff can be helpful
to you.

If for some reason you've poked your head into this repo and like what you see,
feel free to do whatever you want with it.
