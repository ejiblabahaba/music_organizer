ROADMAP (rev 0.3)
=================
0) fix known bugs, implement new ones
	-NamingTools won't work right now because unicode. This doesn't matter much
	 to me, because NamingTools is basically useless to me now. The only use
	 case I could conceive is if I were to reincorporate that test file that's
	 floating around somewhere, and use that for smart file names.
0.5) Make a process which waits in the background, and then updates new torrents
1) FileTools module for file manipulation (it can be done, based on tags)
	-Parsing should now be possible since all directories are standardized
	-Forbidden directories can be avoided by using .STAYOUT files
2) ScrapeTools for metadata web scrape.
	-MUSICBRAINZ MUSICBRAINZ MUSICBRAINZ
3) develop an ErrorTools module to collect, parse, and review errors
4) GUI and other usability improvements
5) add functionality for other file formats I don't use or care about
