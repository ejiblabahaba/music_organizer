ROADMAP: (rev 0.2)
0) fix known bugs, implement new ones
	-prioritize less shady unicode hacks and more clean code
1) get clean values for folder renaming ready for testing and test renaming
2) get all this crap into a SQL database because it's getting overwhelming
3) develop an ErrorTools module to collect, parse, and review errors
4) color-coded CSV to negotiate consensus, if still needed
5) GUI and other usability improvements
6) FileTools module for file manipulation (it can be done, based on tags)
7) ScrapeTools for metadata web scrape. Consider using WCD API, it's curated
8) add functionality for other file formats I don't use or care about
